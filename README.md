# Using-NLP-To-Find-the-Most-Predicitve-Words-of-Hotel-Reviews.
Welcome to our Natural Language Processing (NLP) project for predicting sentiment from hotel reviews and tweets! 
In this project, we use advanced NLP techniques to analyze the sentiment of text data from various sources, such as online hotel 
reviews and social media posts. Our goal is to provide valuable insights and predictions about the sentiment of this text data, 
which can be useful for businesses looking to improve their customer satisfaction and reputation. By using our model, you will 
be able to easily predict the sentiment of any given text, whether it be a hotel review or a tweet, with a high level of accuracy. 
We hope you find this project useful and look forward to your feedback.
